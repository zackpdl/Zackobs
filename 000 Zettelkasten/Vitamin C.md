This video talks about 5 mistakes people make when using vitamin C serum for their skin.

2. **Timing:** It is recommended to use vitamin C serum during the day time, before applying sunscreen. This is because vitamin C is an antioxidant, and it helps fight against free radicals from UV radiation.
    
4. **Order:** Vitamin C should be applied immediately after washing your face and before other serums or moisturizers. This is because it is acidic and can be sensitive to changes in pH and temperature.
    
6. **Concentration:** Start with a low concentration of vitamin C, such as 5-10%, and gradually increase it to 10-20% if your skin tolerates it. Do not use a concentration higher than 20%, as it may be too strong for your skin.
    
8. **Using oxidized vitamin C:** Vitamin C loses its potency after a few weeks of being opened and exposed to air and light. Do not use vitamin C if it has turned orange or brown, as it can stain your skin.
    
10. **Using vitamin C with active acne:** Vitamin C can actually worsen acne in some people. This is because it can trigger the skin to produce more free radicals, which can damage the skin. If you have active acne, avoid using pure vitamin C serums. You can instead use a combination of vitamin C, vitamin E, and ferulic acid.
