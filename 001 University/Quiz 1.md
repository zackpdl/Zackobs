## The Lost Pilot
1. **July 2, 1937 Departure:** Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan set off from Lae, New Guinea, for Howland Island, marking the most perilous part of their around-the-world flight.

2. **Challenges during Flight:** Stormy weather forced Earhart to fly at 3,000 meters, consuming fuel rapidly. After about 20 hours, they approached Howland Island, facing difficulty spotting it due to the bright sun.

3. **Communication Breakdown:** Earhart contacted the ship Itasca near Howland, reporting low fuel. Contact was lost, and despite search efforts, Earhart and Noonan were never found.

4. **Theories on Disappearance:**
   - **Crash into the Pacific:** Bright sun may have caused navigation errors, leading to a crash in the Pacific.
   - **Possibly Landing on Nikumaroro:** Some believe Earhart may have landed on Nikumaroro, but recent searches found no conclusive evidence.
   - **Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands:** An extreme theory suggests Earhart flew to the Marshall Islands and returned to the U.S. under a new identity.

5. **Unresolved Mystery:** Despite the likeliness of the crash theory, none of the proposed explanations for Earhart's disappearance have been proven. Ongoing investigations continue to seek conclusive evidence.

6. **Earhart's Wish:** Regardless of the uncertainties, Amelia Earhart's expressed desire was to "go in [her] plane," indicating her strong connection to aviation.
