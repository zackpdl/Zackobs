**Explanation:**

1. **Variable Initialization:** `int sum = 0;` initializes a variable `sum` to store the sum of the elements.

2. **Iteration through Array:** The `for` loop iterates through each element of the array `nums`.

3. **Checking for 6:** If the current element is equal to 6 (`nums[i] == 6`), it enters a `while` loop.

4. **Skipping Elements:** The `while` loop continues until the next element is 7 (`nums[i] != 7`). It increments the index `i` to skip elements between 6 and 7.

5. **Adding to Sum:** If the current element is not 6, it adds the element to the sum (`sum += nums[i]`).

6. **Returning Sum:** Finally, the method returns the calculated sum.

**Example:**

Consider the array `nums = {1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8}`.

- The method encounters `6` and skips elements until it finds `7`.
- The sum is calculated as `1 + 2 + 8 = 11`.
- The method returns `11` as the final sum.

**Use Case:**

This method calculates the sum of an array with a special rule: it skips elements between a `6` and the next `7`. This can be useful in scenarios where specific elements need to be excluded from the sum based on certain conditions.
