| Logic       | ∼p     | not p                                              | 25   |
|             | p ∧ q  | p and q                                            | 25   |
|             | p ∨ q  | p or q                                             | 25   |
|             | p ⊕ q  | p or q but not both p and q                       | 28   |
|             | P ≡ Q  | P is logically equivalent to Q                     | 30   |
|             | p → q  | if p then q                                        | 40   |
|             | p ↔ q  | p if and only if q                                 | 45   |
|             | ∴      | therefore                                          | 51   |
|             | P(x)   | predicate in x                                     | 97   |
|             | P(x) ⇒ Q(x) | every element in the truth set for P(x) is in the truth set for Q(x) | 104 |
|             | P(x) ⇔ Q(x) | P(x) and Q(x) have identical truth sets                | 104 |
|             | ∀      | for all                                            | 101  |
|             | ∃      | there exists                                       | 103  |
